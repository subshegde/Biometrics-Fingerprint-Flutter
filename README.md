# Biometric Authentication with GitHub Repository Integration

🚀 **Exciting New Flutter Project: Biometric Authentication with GitHub Repository Integration** 🚀

I’m thrilled to share my latest project, where I integrated biometric authentication (fingerprint scanning) into a Flutter app, along with pulling real-time GitHub repository data! 💻🔐

## Key Features:

- 🔒 **Biometric Authentication**: Secure login using fingerprint recognition to access sensitive data.
- 💻 **GitHub Repository Viewer**: Fetches and displays public GitHub repositories of a specific user using the GitHub API.
- 🌐 **Internet Connectivity Check**: Ensures a stable internet connection before making API calls.
- ⚡ **Efficient Performance**: Implements pagination for fetching data in chunks, improving app responsiveness.

## Tools and Packages:

- **Flutter**: The powerful framework for cross-platform mobile development.
- **Local Authentication**: Used for fingerprint-based authentication (`local_auth` package).
- **HTTP**: To fetch GitHub repository data from the API.
- **Provider**: For state management and making the app more scalable.
- **Internet Connection Checker**: To check network connectivity before API calls.
- **Shared Preferences**: For storing and retrieving cached data locally.

## Watch out for:

- **Lottie Animations**: Adds smooth interactions and visual feedback (like the fingerprint scanning animation).
- **Clean UI/UX**: Seamlessly integrates GitHub repository details (e.g., repository name, description, language, and more).

## Why This Project?

- **Security**: Biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security to your app.
- **GitHub API**: Connecting to GitHub via its API is a great way to show your coding projects or fetch data dynamically.
- **Real-world App**: This can serve as a base for a developer portfolio viewer or any app requiring secure access and external data fetching.
